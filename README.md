# React + Vite (LOL cards)

Hello, this is an application made in React, using the Vite platform.
The project is intended to be a card game, at the moment, it only has the logic and functionality of exchanging cards.
Give an npm install in the file terminal if you want to install it on your machine, to install the necessary dependencies.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
